Short Summary:-
Wisdom of the Crowd (Ensembling) vs. Individual Models
We explored both individual models and ensemble methods:

Individual models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN

Ensemble model: Random Forest

Finding:
Random Forest, an ensemble of decision trees, outperformed the individual models based on accuracy and ROC-AUC:

Accuracy ≈ 99.16%

ROC-AUC ≈ 0.957
Yes, the ensemble model (Random Forest) performed better overall, which supports the idea of “wisdom of the crowd”: combining multiple decision trees reduced overfitting and improved generalization.

Interpretability
While Random Forests are powerful, they are harder to interpret directly compared to Decision Trees or Logistic Regression.

Ways to Interpret:
Feature Importance (already done):

We mentioned Age and status_year as key predictors.

We can plot feature importances via:

importances = best_rf.named_steps['classifier'].feature_importances_
features = X.columns
pd.Series(importances, index=features).sort_values(ascending=False).plot(kind='bar')
SHAP values:
For a more nuanced, employee-level interpretation of model decisions:

import shap
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(best_rf.named_steps['classifier'])
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)
shap.summary_plot(shap_values[1], X)
Partial Dependence Plots (PDP):
Visualize how a feature impacts predictions.

from sklearn.inspection import plot_partial_dependence
plot_partial_dependence(best_rf.named_steps['classifier'], X, features=['age', 'length_of_service'])

What Features Mattered in Predicting Attrition?
From the classification report and general intuition:

Age: Often linked with career transitions, promotions, or retirement.

Length of service: Correlates with job satisfaction and burnout.

Job title category / City size: May reflect job security and living costs.

Check:
pd.Series(best_rf.named_steps['classifier'].feature_importances_, index=X.columns).sort_values(ascending=False)

Next Steps & Recommendations
Add XGBoost or LightGBM for performance and interpretability trade-offs.

Use SMOTE or stratified sampling to address class imbalance.

Perform cross-company generalization

Build an interactive dashboard with Streamlit or Dash to monitor attrition risk predictions live.

Detailed Summary:
=================
The objective of this project is to create and evaluate prediction models for employee attrition in order to pinpoint workers who could be at danger of quitting the organization. We will train and optimize five distinct categorization modelsᅳNeural Network, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regressionᅳin order to precisely forecast employee turnover. Based on current employee data, these models will help determine which employees are most likely to depart. 

To determine which of these models is the most effective, we will assess and contrast their respective performances. After the top model has been determined, we will investigate it further to identify the essential components that greatly enhance its functionality.We will look at specific predictions to see how the algorithm makes decisions for certain employees.This will help us gain a greater understanding of the prediction process and the factors influencing each decision. 

Ultimately, these insights will be utilized to propose strategies for future work in predicting and minimizing staff attrition, helping the company improve employee retention through proactive handling of potential turnover. 

#### Rationale
This question is important for providing employers with key insights into reasons why employees might possibly leave their company. By utilizing models to track and predict reasons they can implement mitigating factors that can help retain talent and ensure future talent aren't impacted by the same reasons. Employees can also better understand reasons why people are leaving specific companies and use that to help them assess options when looking at prospective jobs.

#### Research Question
Can we predict which employees are likely to leave a company?

#### Data Sources
The data source for this is a Kaggle Dataset called [Employee Attrition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/HRAnalyticRepository/employee-attrition-data/data) which provides information regarding length of service, termination date, status (target variable), business unit, job title, department, city, and other information. It has about 49700 data points and is fairly clean data with no missing or unknown values.

#### Methodology
For this analysis and to answer the research question, I utilized four models to evaluate and analyze which would provide the best accuracy and results. The four models include: 
Logistic Regression
    *  Built for binary classification tasks which could work well in this dataset looking at yes/no for attrition
*   Decision Tree
    *    Able to capture non-linear relationships between features and target variable.
*   Random Forest
    *    Taking advantage of multiple decision trees can provide for more accuracy over a singular decision tree model and help resolve overfitting issues
*   K-Nearest Neighbors
    *     Flexible alternative to some of the other models that doesn't require any specific data distribution


Note: Will add more in depth details in the Readme file at the last module
